# ContactRegisterForEvolent
Contact register application with CRUD operations using MVC, Web API and EF Code first approach

This is a working solution with ASP.NET MVC (Presentation), Web API (Business) and Entity Framework Code First for database operations.

The application is currently working with above solution.

Due to time constraint I could not implement below.
TODO: (If time permits)
1> Implement the Unit Of Work for Entity Framework  - Done
2> Implement dependency injection for the Contact repository so the web api can be independent with CRUD operations...
3> Global error handling using exception filters
4> Implement Log4Net for logging
5> Unit test project and using MOQ to mock the objects
